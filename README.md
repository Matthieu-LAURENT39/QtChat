# QtChat
A simple chat written with PySide6 and Qt.  
It was coded in under 24h to learn PySide and socket.io  

## Features:
- Server-Client model
- Automatic discovery of servers on LAN via broadcasting
- Use of websockets with automatic reconnection
- Simple commands (kick or ban by ip/hostname/username, roll a dice, flip a coin, etc...)
- Unique color for each user thanks to [distinctipy](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/distinctipy)
